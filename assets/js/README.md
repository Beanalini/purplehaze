# Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

This challenge forms part of the course work for week 6, Module 6, set by the University of Birmingham and Trilogy Ltd's Coding Bootcamp.

## Project Description
---

The aim of this challenge was to build a weather dashboard , from scratch, to display current weather and a five day weather forcast for a user selected city. The [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)  has been used to retrieve weather data for a user selected city.  User searches are added to search history for easier access.

## Project Requirements
---
This challenge required the app to run in the browswer and include dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScipt/JQurey code.

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
